# Blender-Red-Theme
Perfect for Shadow State 2

## About
This theme was inspired by a gag found in [Ian Hubert's Dynamo ep3](https://youtu.be/E8X4pVVYWn8?feature=shared&t=535) in which the dwellers were particularly sensitive to anything that wasn't red light, so I made this for all the Shadow State 2 dwellers out there. Have fun with this.
